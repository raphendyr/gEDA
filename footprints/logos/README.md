# Open Source Hardware logos

These nice logos are from [Evil Mad Scientist](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2011/the-open-source-hardware-logo/).

Outlines are converted to element files, but filled ones are not. So "Import layout data from file" to include them,

Files are labeled "openhardware" instead of "opensourcehardware" as logos contain that name,
